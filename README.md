# hahnmade

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scripts

The project has Sass installed.


Now you can rename src/App.css to src/App.scss and update src/App.js to import src/App.scss. This file and any other file will be automatically compiled if imported with the extension .scss or .sass.

To share variables between Sass files, you can use Sass's @use rule. For example, src/App.scss and other component style files could include @use "./shared.scss"; with variable definitions.

This will allow you to do imports like
